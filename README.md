### Precautions
- After an attempt to make a reservation, the automatic reservation program might stop.
- There is no guarantee that the reservation attempt will succeed.
- If you try again after a reservation attempt, you will need to start all over again.
- Please run only one or two programs at the same time. If you run excessively, your Kakao account may be suspended.
- Please do not allow terminal multiplexing programs such as `tmux` and `screen` to run automatically.

### Download Tip

- On the Release tab, you can download the version that confirms that there is no problem.

## Reservation for NAVER Remaining Vaccines
### Precautions
